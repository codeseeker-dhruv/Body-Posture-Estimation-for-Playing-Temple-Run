# Body Posture Estimation for Playing Temple Run
This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques and real-time body posture estimation to create a gesture-based control system for the game Temple Run. By identifying key body joints (shoulders, hips, waist, hands, legs), players can interact with the game without the need for traditional controls, introducing an immersive, full-body gaming experience.

## Technical Overview
### Tools and Technologies:
Pose Estimation Models: The system uses pre-trained models like OpenPose or MediaPipe for body posture estimation. These models are capable of identifying keypoints in human bodies and detecting various body joints in real time.

Real-Time Detection: The detection pipeline is powered by real-time object detection libraries like YOLO (You Only Look Once), enabling fast and accurate pose recognition that translates to in-game movements.

OpenCV: Used for video capture, frame processing, and integration with camera feeds, allowing the system to process real-time video input from users.

Python: The core logic for gesture interpretation, movement mapping, and interaction with the game is written in Python. Libraries such as NumPy and Pandas are used for data processing, while PyGame facilitates game control.

TensorFlow/Keras: For model integration, tuning, and deploying pose estimation models. Custom pose-mapping algorithms are designed to handle movement detection with high precision.

## System Architecture:
Video Input: Real-time video capture is facilitated using OpenCV, which continuously feeds live frames into the system for processing.

Pose Detection: Each frame is passed through the pose estimation model (OpenPose/MediaPipe), where it detects joint positions.

Gesture Recognition: Detected body postures are mapped to specific gestures, such as jumping, ducking, or turning, which are then translated into game controls.

Game Integration: The gestures are relayed to the Temple Run interface via keyboard inputs simulated by PyGame, allowing the character to respond to physical body movements.

## Use Cases
### Gaming with Body Gestures:
Players perform physical movements (e.g., jumping, crouching, or leaning) to control their character in the game. This hands-free approach enhances user engagement and physical activity during gameplay.

### Healthcare and Rehabilitation:
Posture Monitoring: The system can be adapted to track usersâ€™ posture in healthcare environments, such as during physical therapy sessions. It can provide feedback on body alignment, encouraging correct movements.
Physiotherapy Gamification: This project can help gamify rehabilitation exercises, making therapy more interactive and enjoyable for patients.

### Fitness and Exercise Tracking:
The pose estimation technology can be utilized for tracking movements during workouts. It can detect incorrect postures, providing real-time feedback to users to ensure safe and effective exercises.

### E-Sports and Immersive Gaming:
The project can be extended to other action-oriented games, allowing players to control avatars through body gestures in competitive e-sports environments, adding an immersive edge to the experience.


## Future Enhancements
-> Cross-Platform Integration: Future developments could focus on integrating this system with VR/AR gaming platforms, bringing even more immersive and responsive controls to next-gen gaming.

-> Improved Accuracy: Through deeper integration of more advanced machine learning models, the system can increase the accuracy of joint and gesture detection, enabling better control precision.

-> Healthcare Wearables: Integrating this technology with wearable sensors can enhance posture correction and physical rehabilitation by providing real-time feedback on patient movements.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the integration of real-time computer vision, machine learning, and gaming to create a hands-free control system that has potential applications beyond entertainment, particularly in healthcare and fitness.
